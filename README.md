## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git) and pasting it to `themes/hello-friend-ng` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

``` bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```

## How to deploy

To deploy the website locally ([localhost:1313](localhost:1313)) use :
``` bash
$ hugo server
```

To publish static files of the website on public directory, use:
``` bash
$ hugo
```
